Stairs
======

Stairs aims to be a minimalistic web framework. It provides a time limited
template rendering mechanism that reloads unfinished parts using JSON.

Installation
------------
Stairs is not available through clojars yet. Download the source and include it
or build your own jar. Once Stairs is in reasonable good shape, we will provide
a clojar.

Current Status
--------------
Do not use it. Play around with it, but seriously this is very very unfinished
stuff.
